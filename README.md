# headless_gulp

A quick and dirty set up to give Tailwind a try. Uses Gulp and Pug. 

- Clone repo
- Do the usual NPM dance to install 100000000 weird dependencies... (you might also need the gulp CLI, not sure) 
- If you don't like PUG just right regular HTML in the pug template and it'll work fine. 
- Then just run 'gulp' in the main folder and it will watch for your changes and rebuild into the the 'build' folder so you can look at stuff. 

The end.
